O123

(Test the conversion between inches and mm. Remember,
 the system defaults to whatever was chosen in the "Set
 Geometry" dialog.)

G00 X1 Y1; X2 Y2;G20

X4 Y4;G21 X100Y100 G20 X10 Y10

G02 X1 Y1 Z1 I0 J1 F22

G16
G02 X1 Y1 Z1 I0 J1  (no arcs in PC mode!)
G15

(Only use two of the three I/J/K values.)
G03 X1 Y1 Z1 I1 J1 K1 R2 (this is caught by the parser)
