(
To test the Layer02 class. This class takes care of TLO and work offsets --
G43, 44, 49 TLO and G52, 53-59. I also verify that the extra statements
from an M06 are generated.

To test these things, you must load or set values in the "Tool Table"
dialog -- for TLO -- or in the "Work Offsets" dialog.
