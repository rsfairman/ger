(To test the Lexer class.)
(There are a lot of different errors possible:)
( D-values should be given as D[whole number].)
( F-values should be given as F[floating point number].)
( G-values should be given as G[whole number].)
( H-values should be given as H[whole number].)
( I/J/K-values should be given as I[floating point number].)
( L/N/M/O values are whole numbers.) 
( P and Q are treated as doubles in the lexer.)
( R is a floating point number.)
( S is a whole number.)
( T is a whole number.)
( U is a floating point number.)
( X/Y/Z are floating point numbers.)

(All that the lexer is really doing is reading things for the form)
(XY, where X is a letter and Y is a number, either floating point)
(or a whole number. The code here is almost identical in every case,)
(so this just tests a few cases.)

(What you should see are a bunch of lexical errors, together with some)
(properly formed tokens.)

( I also want
to
test
mult-line
comments
)

(Also, what if a comment runs off the end of a file?
 Remove the close-parenthesis to find out.)
