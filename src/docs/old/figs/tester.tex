% Most of the time this line will work, provided the bounding box is what
% it should be and the picture is centered in the bbox. Otherwise, use
%\includegraphics[x1,y1][x2,y2]{test3.131}
% where (x1,y1) is the lower left corner we want and (x2,y2) is the
% upper right. However, I thought that it worked differently....
