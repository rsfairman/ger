To test the Layer03 class, which eliminates polar coordinates from the stream. 
It also removes linear "moves" from the stream that do not actually move the
tool.

X4 Y90  (move to 0.0,4.0 at 90 degrees)
X2 Y180 (move to -2.0,0.0)
X1 Y45  (move to 1/sqrt 2,1/sqrt 2 )

G18 (ZX-plane, so x = angle, z = distance)

(
Think of the z-axis like the x-axis and the x-axis like the y-axis.
So we measure the angle from the z-axis toward the x-axis as we move
CCW. Remember, all moves in absolute mode are relative to the temporary
origin at the tool's position before entering PC mode.
)

X90 Z1   (increase x by 1, z stays the same)
X180 Z2  (decrease z by 2, x stays the same)
X45 Z1   (x and z both increase by 0.707 = 1/sqrt s)

G19 (YZ-plane, so Y = distance, Z = angle)

(
Think of the y-axis like the x-axis and the z-axis like the y-axis.
We measure the angle from the y-axis toward the z-axis moving CCW.
We're still using the same origin as in the previous few statements
since we haven't left PC mode.
)

Y1 Z90  (z increases by 1, y stays the same)
Y2 Z180 (y decreases by 2, z stays the same)
Y1 Z45  (y and z both increase by 0.707 = q/sqrt 2)

G15 (out of PC mode)

X1 Y1 

G16 (back to PC mode)

G91 (incremental mode)

(
In incremental mode, the origin of the PC moves changes with each move.
Remember, we are still in incremental mode after this layer filters out
the PC moves, so the answer will be in relative terms until it passes
through Layer04.
