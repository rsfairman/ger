M41 (should be filtered out: spindle hi/low)

M98 P124 L4 (try commenting out the L4 to see if it does call the sub-program once.)
            (Another test: see what happens if the program number refers to a number
             that's never defined -- no program defined under that O-value. )

M30  (Try leaving this out and see what happens)

G01 X1 Y1 F17

O125 (generates an error; switch this to O124)
M06 T12
X1 Z1
M99      (Subroutine return. Try leaving this off)

O125  (Should cause an error: reusing program number)
      (Change the number to 129 and try again. 
       That will mean that the sub-program call above refers to a
       non-existant O-value.)
