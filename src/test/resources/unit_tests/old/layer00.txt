(To test Layer00)
(There's not a lot that could go wrong since Layer00 serves only to get rid of)
(M98 and M99 for calling sub-programs.)
(Possible errors and warnings: )
(  No program number at the start of the program.)
(  Using the same program number more than once.)
(  Bogus codes, like G400.)

(See what happens with an unclosed comment:)

O123
SimpleWiz 4
(M30) (what happens if the program immediately halts?)

(Some bad G-codes)
(
G300
G-11
)

M41 (should be filtered out: spindle hi/low)

M98 P124 L4 (try commenting out the L4 to see if it does call the sub-program once.)
            (Another test: see what happens if the program number refers to a number
             that's never defined -- no program defined under that O-value. )
G00
X1 Y1

M30  (Try leaving this out and see what happens)

G01 X1 Y1 F17
X2 Y3

O125 (generates an error; switch this to O124)
M06 T12
X1 Z1
M99      (Subroutine return. Try leaving this off)

O125  (Should cause an error: reusing program number)
      (Change the number to 129 and try again. 
       That will mean that the sub-program call above refers to a
       non-existant O-value.)
