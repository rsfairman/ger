// A JComboBox used inside a ToolTable (inside a ToolDialog) to choose among
// a limited number of types of tool.

// BUG: I have not done this. The idea was to have a JComboBox in the first column
// of the tool table, and this would show certain standard tools, like endmills,
// ballmills, drills (with different angles) and the like, along with a choice to
// let the user create his own shape.
